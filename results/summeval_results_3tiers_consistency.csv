dm-test-8764fb95bfad8ee849274873a92fb8d6b400eee2,1.0,"After reading the news article and the summary, I will evaluate the consistency of the summary.

The summary states that Paul Merson was brought on with only seven minutes remaining in his team's 0-0 draw with Burnley, which is consistent with the article. However, the summary also states that Andros Townsend scored the Tottenham midfielder in the 89th minute, which is incorrect. The article does not mention Townsend scoring a goal against Burnley.

Additionally, the summary does not mention the context of Merson's previous criticism of Townsend, which is an important detail in understanding the situation.

The summary contains some factual errors that are not supported by the article. Specifically:

* The summary states that Chelsea's interest in Muto is not linked to the £200million deal, but the article actually quotes Ogane as saying that the interest is not connected to the sponsorship deal.
* The summary incorrectly states that Muto is a Dutch player, when in fact he is a Japanese international.

The summary accurately reports the facts about the speed camera being turned off in the West Midlands and the reason for it (old technology). The summary also mentions the 30mph speed limit and the location of the camera in Handsworth, Birmingham.

However, the summary does not mention the fact that the camera was re-pointed at a house and that the council is aware of it and plans to remove it. This information is present in the article, but not in the summary.

After reading the news article and the summary, I found that the summary is mostly consistent with the article. The summary accurately states that the speed camera was previously enforcing the 30mph speed limit and that it has not been working for two years. However, the summary does not mention the reason why the camera was switched off, which is mentioned in the article as being due to the technology becoming obsolete.

After reading the news article and the summary, I can see that the summary only contains one sentence that is a direct quote from the article. The sentence ""Speed camera has been turned round and is pointing at this house in Birmingham, West Midlands"" is a factual statement that is supported by the article.

However, the summary does not provide any additional context or information about the situation, such as the reason why the camera was turned around, the reaction of the authorities, or the impact on the residents. This lack of context makes the summary incomplete and potentially misleading.

After reading the news article and the summary, I noticed that the summary is mostly accurate and consistent with the article. The summary correctly states that the speed camera had previously enforced the 30mph speed limit and that it has not been working for two years after all fixed devices were switched off in the West Midlands.

The summary contains some factual errors that are not supported by the article. For example, it states that Paul Downton was the host of England's managing director, which is incorrect. The article actually states that Paul Downton was the managing director of England, not the host. Additionally, the summary implies that Pietersen joked with reporters at the Kia Oval, but the article only mentions that he joked with photographers.

* The article does not mention the England captain being sacked as managing director. Instead, it mentions the dismissal of Paul Downton as England's managing director.
* The article does not mention Pietersen being in talks with Surrey for several weeks. Instead, it mentions that Pietersen has rejoined Surrey in an attempt to force his way back into the Test set-up.

The summary is mostly consistent with the article. It accurately reports the description of the offender, the items stolen, and the date of the robbery. However, the summary only mentions the event happening once, whereas the article mentions it happening twice (at 12:30 pm and on Saturday).

I would rate the consistency of the summary as 4 out of 5. The summary is mostly accurate, but it lacks some details present in the original article.

The summary accurately conveys the main points of the article, including the fact that Ian Guffick was banned from the classroom and that he allowed pupils to cheat on their SATs exam. However, the summary contains some factual errors that are not supported by the article.

The summary contains some factual errors that are not supported by the article. Specifically:

* The summary states that the current crop of young players is the most talented ever assembled by the game, but the article does not mention this. The article only quotes the former England managers as saying that the pool of English talent playing at the top level is shrinking and that it's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager.

Consistency: 4/5

The summary is mostly factually consistent with the source article.

The summary states that Bayern Munich beat Porto 6-1 in the Champions League on Tuesday, which is a fact supported by the article. The summary also mentions that Pep Guardiola's underwear was on show after the incident, which is also a fact supported by the article.

However, the summary does not mention the details about the score at halftime, which is 5-0 in favor of Bayern Munich, as stated in the article. This is a minor inconsistency, but it does not affect the overall factual accuracy of the summary.

The summary is very similar to the article, and it contains the same facts and quotes. The only difference is that the summary does not mention the specific details about the ship's location and the discovery of the bodies by the cleaning staff.

I would rate the consistency of the summary as 4 out of 5. The summary is mostly factually accurate and aligns well with the article. However, it lacks some details that are present in the article, which slightly reduces its consistency score.
